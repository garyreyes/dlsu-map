# Project facts

Durable facts about this project that aren't obvious from the code and shouldn't have to be re-explained each
session. Safety rules live in `CLAUDE.md`; reasons for decisions live in `docs/DECISIONS.md`; what changed when lives
in `docs/CHANGES.md`. Add a fact with the date you learned it. Delete it when it stops being true.

## Repo and people

- The repo is `github.com/garyreyes/dlsu-map`, public, default branch `main`. Gary Reyes owns it, so only Gary's
  account can change settings such as branch protection. (2026-10-19)
- `main` is protected by a repository ruleset (id 25407958), on since 2026-10-19: PR required with 0 approvals,
  `gates` required and the branch up to date with `main`, no force-push, no deletion. Without `gh`, a branch is
  pushed from the terminal and the PR is opened and merged on github.com. (2026-10-19)
- Charles's GitHub account is `charlesco-05`, with write access to the repo (can open and merge PRs, not change
  settings). (2026-10-19)
- The required CI check is named **`gates`**. Renaming the job breaks branch protection until the rule is updated
  to match. (2026-10-19)

## Local machine (Windows)

- Node 24 is installed (via winget) but isn't on the Git Bash PATH by default. Prepend it:
  `export PATH="/c/Program Files/nodejs:$PATH"`. PowerShell finds it normally. (2026-10-19)
- The GitHub CLI (`gh` 2.102.0) is installed on Charles's laptop at `C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe`. A Git Bash
  session opened before the install doesn't have it on PATH; use the full path or open a new terminal. Gary's laptop
  has `gh` 2.96.0, signed in as `garyreyes` with admin on the repo. (2026-10-19)
- Git converts line endings (`core.autocrlf`), so "LF will be replaced by CRLF" warnings are expected and harmless.

## Working on the code

- Setup after cloning: Node 24, then `npm ci` (also installs the Husky hook). `npm run dev` starts Vite.
- Before a PR: `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run build`, which are the same commands CI runs.
- **TypeScript (D1):** `@typescript/typescript6@6.0.2` is the package version but it contains compiler 6.0.3; ESLint
  and the editor use it. `@typescript/native` is `typescript@7`, and `npm run typecheck` calls its `tsc` by full
  path. `tsc` 7 runs in build mode (`-b`) over `tsconfig.app.json` (src/) and `tsconfig.node.json` (configs, tests,
  scripts, tools). (2026-10-19)
- **Line endings:** `.gitattributes` forces LF in the working copy on every OS. Without it, Windows checkouts get CRLF
  and `prettier --check` fails locally while passing in Linux CI. (2026-10-19)
- **Layer rules** (`eslint.boundaries.js`) use built-in ESLint rules only. They cover static and dynamic `import()`,
  but not CommonJS `require` or aliasing `window` to a variable before calling `.fetch`; review catches those.
  Feature code lives either at the feature's top level (logic) or under `components/` (UI); any other subfolder is
  treated as logic. (2026-10-19)

## OpenStreetMap data

- **Overpass is unreliable from here:** every public mirror returned 502/504 or timed out on 2026-10-19 and
  2026-10-20. The main API (`api.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/map.json?bbox=…`) answered in about 3 s with 2.5 MB, so
  `npm run fetch-osm` uses it (D27). It needs a `User-Agent` naming the app. (2026-10-20)
- **An area request cuts relations at its edge.** It returns every way touching the area in full, but a relation
  only with the members that touch it. The campus boundary (relation 11126048) came back with 2 of its 9 ways, so
  the script fetches such relations again with `/relation/<id>/full`. Every building came back complete. (2026-10-20)
- The campus boundary is 9 separate outer rings, 5 of them bike-parking areas, plus gates and entrances as points on
  its ways. Miguel Hall (relation 6095002) is a multipolygon with a courtyard hole. `type=building` relations (One
  Archers' Place, a hotel) add no shape: their outline and parts are ordinary ways. (2026-10-20)
- Ways come back complete even far outside the area: the LRT line way runs the length of Manila with all its
  stations. The compiler clips to what the scene needs. (2026-10-20)
- Node 24 runs `scripts/*.ts` directly (type stripping), so scripts import other `.ts` files with the extension and
  need no build step. `Object.groupBy` isn't available: `tsconfig.node.json` targets ES2023. (2026-10-20)

## Cloudflare

- The free Cloudflare account is Gary's, signed in with GitHub. Never upgrade it to Workers Paid (D11).
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` is a user API token made from the **Edit Cloudflare Workers** template, scoped to this one
  account (My Profile → API Tokens). Tokens in the current format start with `cfut_`. Both it and
  `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` are GitHub Actions secrets only. (2026-10-19)
- Adding a secret on github.com: the token goes in the **Secret** box, not **Name**. A secret whose name looks like
  random characters is a pasted token: delete it and roll the token in Cloudflare. (2026-10-19)

## Tool versions pinned in CI

- `markdownlint-cli2@0.23.3`: an exact-pinned devDependency since 1a, and CI's `npx` step uses the same version. Bump
  both together. Its dependencies carry dev-only `npm audit` warnings (braces, katex, smol-toml); the shipped app has
  none (`npm audit --omit=dev` is clean). (2026-10-19)
- `impeccable@4.6.0` for the design detector, to match the locally installed Impeccable plugin. Bump both together.
  Exit 0 = clean, 2 = findings (fails CI), 1 = couldn't scan. Telemetry is off in CI (`DO_NOT_TRACK=1`).
  (2026-10-19)
- GitHub Actions: `actions/checkout@v7` and `actions/setup-node@v7`, both official. No third-party actions: change
  detection is a short shell step instead of `dorny/paths-filter`. (2026-10-19)

## Docs

- `docs/HANDOVER.md` is frozen history and is excluded from markdown lint. Don't reformat it. (2026-10-19)
- The PRD's use-case labels (`**UC2. …**`) are bold text, not headings, on purpose; lint rule MD036 is off for that.
